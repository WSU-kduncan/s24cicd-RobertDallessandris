            Begin Cooking your pasta according to package instructions. Do not over-cook, in fact, for best results cook
            one
            minute less than indicated time. Once finished, drain, drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and toss to coat
            so the
            noodles don't stick together while sitting.
