    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients list">
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pounds bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (4 medium thighs)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds Brussels sprouts, halved</li>
        <li>1/4 large red onion, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="directions list">
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425°F. Grease a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. For easy
            clean up, you can line the pan with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the 1⁄4 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, the Dijon mustard,
            whole-grain mustard, honey, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use tongs to dip the chicken thighs in the sauce, coating both sides. Place the thighs on the prepared
            baking sheet. Discard any remaining sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, combine the Brussels sprouts and red onion. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
            oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice and toss until well coated. Arrange the sprouts and onion around the
            chicken on the baking sheet, making sure they aren’t overlapping. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast for 30 to 35 minutes, until the chicken is golden brown and has an internal temperature of 165°F and
            the Brussels sprouts are crispy. Serve hot.
